# Screen Time Analysis

Hey there! This repo is just some Python scripts I threw together for a high school (LycÃ©e Jean-Piaget) project. It's all about checking out screen time habits including how age affects usage, whether gamers spend more time on screens, work vs. personal time, and social media stuff. The code's not perfect, but it gets the job done with some cool graphs. ðŸ˜„
